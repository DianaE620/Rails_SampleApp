As mentioned in Learn Enough Command Line to Be Dangerous, touch is designed to update the modification 
timestamp of a file or directory without otherwise affecting it, but as a side-effect it creates a new 
(blank) file if one doesnâ€™t already exist. (If using the cloud IDE, you may have to refresh the file tree 
as described in Section 1.3.1. This is a good example of technical sophistication (Box 1.1).)9
